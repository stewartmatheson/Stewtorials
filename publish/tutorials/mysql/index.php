MySQL is typed meaning that it very stiricly checks the type of data thats being inserted in to a given table column. When desinging databases its importent to consider what kind of data will be stored in a database.</p>

What ever the method of connectiong some infomation must be known before hand.  Part of this information is the user account we wish to connect with. This usre account is stored by mysql.
